In this workshop, I learned the concept of inheritance in between classes. The workshop was easy to understand because the concept was pretty straightforward.
My professor provided analogies in his lecture which allowed me to understand inheritance. The workshop also gave me a better understanding of shadowing.
If an identical function exists in both the derived and base class, the derived class overrides the functions of its base class. Virtual functions were not 
applicable in this workshop; however, I still applied it to the destructor as good practice. Essentially, virtual function are functions that guarantees that
the latest version of the function is called in the hierarchy of inheritance. I made my destructors virtual so that if I were to create a parent object pointing to a child class,
it will ensure that the proper destructor is invoked and prevent memory leak. For some reason, I still earned a mark of 50%. No matter how much
I try to prepare for the quiz, I would still get a low mark. I am not sure whether it is the imbalance distribution of points per question or I might not be studying enough.
Hopefully at some point in the course, I can have a positive mindset in the course and not be discouraged towards a low mark.
The 2nd milestone of the project was definitely a stressful assignment. I forgot the idea of prohibiting copy constructors and copy assignment. As a result, I had to spend hours thinking
about properly implementing the copy constructor and copy assignment of the two modules. I also struggled in the initialization of main menu in AidMan module because I was getting segmentation faults. 
I was writing the steps to dynamically allocate a member variable, but I realized that there is a function in Utils that does it for me. 
I learned that I should always check the Utils module and see if I have any functions that I can reuse for my program and avoid
developing a set of statements that would repeat throughout my application.
