This week, I learned about the different types of functions. The basic concept of class was easy to understand because they are identical to structs, which was introduced
to me back in first semester. I learned that class and struct are identical, but the only difference is struct is public by default and class is private by default.
The first part of the workshop was easy because I was able to quickly learn the accessibility of different members. However, the moment that I step into workshop part two,
I realized that I had mistakes which I did not notice. Firstly, I incorrectly defined an object's safe empty state. As a result, I was open to potential semantic errors.
In addition, I made a mistake by placing constant values as private members of a class; this resulted to my inability to access the constant values which was used by a global
function. In the end, I was able to resolve these problems and hopefully I do not make the same mistake of not identifying any semantic errors before submitting my work.
