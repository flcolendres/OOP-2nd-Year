On workshop 4, I was able to practice and test my knowledge on constructors, destructors, and the current object. It was pretty confusing
at first because I was having difficulties understanding the current object specifically. It was quite complex to my understanding.
However, I was able to slowly understood the basics of the *this keyword. I was having some troubles using it because I was unsure when to use 
the "*this" keyword. As I analyzed the main functions of workshop 4, I realized that the keyword simplified the code because it allows member functions
to access the object's instance variables and its data. I was also able to practice the use of constructors and destructors and the way that both procedures are used in a program. 
Constructor is a special member procedure automatically invoked at creation, while Destructors are procedures invoked before going out of scope.
My professor told me not to call constructors and destructors a function because it cannot be invoked like a normal function.
I think it is easy to identify which is a constructor and a destructor because it has the same name as the class. In addition,
it is also easy to differentiate constructors and destructors by checking which has the tilde "~" symbol.
