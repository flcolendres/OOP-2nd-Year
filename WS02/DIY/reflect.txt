	This week's topic talks about Static and Dynamic Memory allocation. I learned that memory leaks occur when a memory obtained from an application is not deallocated. 
According to my professor, it is a common occurrence in software development.
I was fascinated to find out that memory leak is one of the reasons why internet speed is slow. 
I struggled in this workshop because I was frustrated on where the memory was leaking. In the first part of the workshop, I realized that I did not 
deallocate the dynamic memory array; instead, I set it to nullptr. 
I learned that an array has to be deallocated before being set to nullptr, or else it would have a memory leftover before exiting the program. 
In addition, I also learned about the types of scopes. Certain variables are visible within a scope depending on where they are declared.
A function can have the same identifier as long as the signature different. Based on what I learned, a function signature makes a function unique
depending on the identifier, types of parameter, and the order of the parameter. Overall, this week's lesson was slightly complicated, and it took some time
to fully understand the meaning of these keywords.
